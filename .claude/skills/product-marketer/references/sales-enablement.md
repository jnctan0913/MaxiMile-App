## Objection Handling Framework

### LAER Model (Listen, Acknowledge, Explore, Respond)

1. **Listen**: Let the prospect fully articulate their concern. Don't interrupt.
2. **Acknowledge**: Show empathy and validate their concern. "That's a fair point..."
3. **Explore**: Ask clarifying questions to understand the root concern. "Can you tell me more about...?"
4. **Respond**: Address the concern directly with evidence and reframe. "What we've found is..."

### Common Objection Categories

| "Competitor X is cheaper" | Competitive | Highlight total cost of ownership, differentiated value |
| "We don't have budget right now" | Timing | Offer trial, start small, show cost of delay |
| "Can you discount?" | Negotiation | Trade (not give) -- offer discount for commitment/referral |

#### Value Objections
| Objection | Type | Response Strategy |
|-----------|------|-------------------|
| "We don't need this" | Awareness | Share relevant case study, quantify the problem |
| "We're happy with current solution" | Status quo | Highlight hidden costs of current approach, show what they're missing |

## Pricing Strategy Deep Dive

### Cost-Based Pricing
```
Price = Total Cost (production + distribution + marketing) + Desired Margin

Pros: Simple, ensures profitability
Cons: Ignores customer value and competition
Best for: Commodity products, cost-competitive markets
```

### Value-Based Pricing
```
Price = Customer's Perceived Value of the Solution

Steps:
1. Quantify the customer's problem (cost of pain)
2. Quantify your solution's impact (value delivered)
3. Price at a fraction of value delivered (typically 10-30%)

Pros: Higher margins, customer-aligned
Cons: Requires deep customer understanding, harder to set
Best for: B2B, differentiated products, unique solutions
```

### Competitive Pricing
```
Price = Competitor Price +/- Positioning Adjustment

Strategies:
- Price Above: Premium positioning (must justify with differentiation)
- Price At: Match market (compete on other dimensions)
- Price Below: Cost-effective positioning (must maintain margins)

Pros: Market-aligned, easy to communicate
Cons: Reactive, doesn't capture unique value
Best for: Established categories, competitive markets
```

### Dynamic Pricing
```
Price = Base Price * f(demand, time, customer, inventory)

Variables: Market demand, time of purchase, customer segment,
           supply/availability, competitor pricing

Pros: Maximizes revenue, responsive to market
Cons: Customer perception risk, complexity
Best for: Travel, hospitality, ride-sharing, e-commerce
```

### Freemium / Tiered Pricing
```
Tier 1 (Free):  Limited features -> Acquisition & awareness
Tier 2 (Basic): Core features    -> Revenue from SMB/individuals
Tier 3 (Pro):   Full features    -> Revenue from power users
Tier 4 (Ent):   Custom           -> Revenue from enterprise

Key decisions:
- What's free vs paid? (feature-based, usage-based, time-based)
- What triggers upgrade? (hitting limits, needing collaboration, support)
- Free-to-paid conversion target? (typically 2-5% for B2C, 10-20% for B2B)

Pros: Low barrier to entry, viral potential, self-serve
Cons: High free-user cost, conversion optimization required
Best for: SaaS, developer tools, consumer apps
```
