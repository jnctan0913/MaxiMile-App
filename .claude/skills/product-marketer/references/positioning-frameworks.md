# Positioning Frameworks Reference

## April Dunford's Positioning Framework

April Dunford's "Obviously Awesome" framework provides a structured approach to product positioning:

### 5-Step Positioning Process

1. **Competitive Alternatives** -- What would customers use if your product didn't exist?
2. **Unique Attributes** -- What features/capabilities do you have that alternatives lack?
3. **Value** -- What value do those unique attributes deliver to customers?
4. **Target Customer Characteristics** -- Who cares most about that value?
5. **Market Category** -- What context makes the value obvious to target customers?

### Positioning Statement Template (Dunford)

```
For [target customers]
who are dissatisfied with [current alternative],
our product is a [new category]
that provides [key benefit].
Unlike [competitive alternative],
we [key differentiator].
```

## Perceptual Mapping

A perceptual map visualizes how customers perceive products relative to competitors across two key dimensions.

### How to Build a Perceptual Map

1. **Choose two dimensions** that matter most to your target customers (e.g., Price vs Quality, Simplicity vs Power, Speed vs Accuracy)
2. **Plot competitors** on the map based on customer perception (not your opinion)
3. **Identify whitespace** -- gaps where no competitor exists
4. **Position your product** in the whitespace or redefine dimensions to create new space

```
                    HIGH [Dimension 2]
                    |
     Quadrant A     |    Quadrant B
     [Meaning]      |    [Meaning]
                    |
  ------------------+------------------
                    |
     Quadrant C     |    Quadrant D
     [Meaning]      |    [Meaning]
                    |
                    LOW [Dimension 2]
   LOW [Dim 1] -------------------- HIGH [Dim 1]
```

### Common Dimension Pairs

| Pair | Best For |
|------|----------|
| Price vs Quality | Consumer goods, SaaS |
| Ease of Use vs Feature Richness | Software products |
| Speed vs Accuracy | Data/analytics tools |
| Customization vs Simplicity | Enterprise vs SMB |
| Innovation vs Reliability | Tech products |

## Positioning Statement Formats

### Classic Format
> For [target segment] who [statement of need], [product name] is a [product category] that [key benefit]. Unlike [competitor/alternative], our product [primary differentiator].

### Problem-Solution Format
> [Target users] struggle with [problem]. [Product name] solves this by [solution], resulting in [measurable benefit]. Unlike [alternatives], we [differentiator].

### Jobs-to-be-Done Format
> When [situation], [target users] want to [job to be done], so they can [desired outcome]. [Product name] helps them do this by [how], which is better than [alternatives] because [differentiator].

## Value Proposition Canvas (Osterwalder)

### Customer Profile (Right Side)

| Element | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Customer Jobs** | What tasks are customers trying to accomplish? (Functional, social, emotional) |
| **Pains** | What annoys, frustrates, or blocks customers before/during/after the job? |
| **Gains** | What outcomes and benefits do customers desire? (Required, expected, desired, unexpected) |

### Value Map (Left Side)

| Element | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Products & Services** | What do we offer to help customers? |
| **Pain Relievers** | How do our products/services alleviate specific customer pains? |
| **Gain Creators** | How do our products/services create specific customer gains? |

### Fit Assessment
- **Problem-Solution Fit**: Do our pain relievers and gain creators match customer pains and gains?
- **Product-Market Fit**: Evidence that customers actually value and pay for our solution

## Storytelling Frameworks

### The Hero's Journey (Applied to Product)
1. **Ordinary World**: Customer's current state with the problem
2. **Call to Adventure**: Realization that there must be a better way
3. **Mentor Appears**: Your product/brand enters the picture
4. **Crossing the Threshold**: Customer decides to try your solution
5. **Tests & Allies**: Onboarding, learning, early wins
6. **The Ordeal**: The moment your product truly proves its value
7. **The Reward**: Customer achieves their goal
8. **Return Transformed**: Customer's new reality with measurable improvement

### StoryBrand Framework (Donald Miller)
1. **A Character** (the customer) has a **Problem**
2. And meets a **Guide** (your brand) who gives them a **Plan**
3. And calls them to **Action**
4. That helps them avoid **Failure**
5. And ends in **Success**

### Before-After-Bridge
1. **Before**: Paint the picture of the customer's world with the problem
2. **After**: Show what life looks like when the problem is solved
3. **Bridge**: Explain how your product gets them from Before to After

## Messaging Hierarchy

### Level 1: Positioning Statement
The foundational statement that defines who you are, what you do, and why it matters.

### Level 2: Value Propositions (3-5 max)
Key benefit statements that support the positioning. Each should be provable.

### Level 3: Proof Points
Evidence that backs up each value proposition (data, testimonials, case studies, features).

### Level 4: Key Messages by Audience
Tailored messaging for each persona/segment that connects to Level 2-3.

### Level 5: Tactical Copy
Headlines, taglines, CTAs, email subject lines, social posts -- all derived from the hierarchy above.

```
Positioning Statement (1)
├── Value Proposition A
│   ├── Proof Point 1
│   ├── Proof Point 2
│   └── Persona-specific message
├── Value Proposition B
│   ├── Proof Point 1
│   ├── Proof Point 2
│   └── Persona-specific message
└── Value Proposition C
    ├── Proof Point 1
    └── Persona-specific message
```
