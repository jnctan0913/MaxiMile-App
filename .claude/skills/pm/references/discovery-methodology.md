# PM Reference: Discovery Methodology

## Phase 1.0: Value Creation Foundation

Before diving into discovery, ground yourself in **value creation** -- the centerpiece of a product manager's job.

**Why it matters**: Value creation is the driver of economic activity. The PM's mission is to be the **voice of the user** and the hand that orchestrates value creation and delivery, constantly bridging the **needs of the user and the business**.

### Core Definitions

- **Persona**: A representation of the user who is facing the problem
- **Goal**: The state the user wants to reach (e.g., completing a task)
- **Pain Point / Friction**: The difficulty the user faces in achieving their goal
- **Job-to-be-Done (JTBD)**: What the goal is fundamentally about
- **Value**: Created when the pain point is removed
- **Opportunity**: When more value can be created compared to the status quo
- **Value Transaction**: Value is only realized when the user actually consumes the product or service

### Value Frameworks

Use these to understand what users truly value:

**Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs**: Physiological -> Safety -> Love/Belonging -> Esteem -> Self-Actualization. Prioritize survival and security needs first; higher-order needs build on this foundation.

**Bain & Company's 30 Elements of Value**: From functional elements (saves time, reduces cost, simplifies) -> emotional elements (reduces anxiety, rewards me) -> life-changing elements (motivation, self-actualization) -> social impact (self-transcendence).

### Measuring Value

How to quantify the value created:
- **Quantifiable metrics**: Better, cheaper, faster (the common trio)
- **Relative metrics**: Expensive vs cheap (context-dependent, relative to alternatives)
- **Subjective metrics**: Happiness, satisfaction, confidence (harder to measure but equally important)

### Value vs Impact

A critical distinction:
- **Value** = benefit to the **user** (did we solve their problem? reduce their friction?)
- **Impact** = effect on the **system/business** (revenue, efficiency, market share, societal outcomes)
- Impact takes a **longer-term, broader view** of the time horizon
- It is possible to have **high value but low impact** (e.g., delighting a niche user group that doesn't move business metrics)
- Always consider both dimensions when evaluating a problem's worthiness

**Key Principle**: Pain points evolve over time due to:
- Changes in user expectations
- Changes in technology
- Changes in user base

## Phase 1.1b-ii: Hypothesis & Differentiation

After defining the problem, formulate a **Hypothesis** (proposed solution) and articulate **Differentiation**:

### Hypothesis -- The proposed solution to the problem

- Should build upon or reference existing products/solutions where applicable
- Describe the core approach and key features
- Must directly address the friction points identified
- Frame as testable: "We believe that [solution] will [achieve goal] for [persona] by [removing friction]"

### Differentiation -- How your hypothesis differs from existing alternatives

- What does your approach do that existing solutions don't?
- Why is it better suited for this specific persona?
- How does it address the friction in a way current approaches cannot?

## Phase 1.1c: User Research Methodologies

Understanding users requires recognizing that:
- **Non-explicit**: Some motivations are subconscious or unconscious (the "Mental Iceberg" -- what users say is only the tip; beneath lie stored knowledge, fears, and deeper needs)
- **Resolution**: Issues may be too complex for users to unpack themselves
- **Time Window**: Immediate reactions may not reflect the real problem; motivations require time to surface

### The 1-2-3 Framework (for identifying real problems)

1. **First Principle Need**: What remains unchanged always -- people's basic needs (Maslow's hierarchy). Ground the problem in fundamental human needs.
2. **Second Order Thinking**: What lies beneath the "Iceberg" -- the unspoken motivation. Look beyond the surface event to trends, structures, and mental models.
3. **Third Person Perspective**: Validate the problem with research and context. We are prone to assumptions and biases when forming solutions.

### Three Research Approaches

| Method | Description | Best For |
|--------|-------------|----------|
| **Observation** | Observing users in their natural environment to discover unarticulated pain points and motivations | Identifying pain points users may not be aware of or cannot articulate |
| **Engagement** | Conducting interviews (non-verbal cues, tailored questioning) and surveys (targeted data collection, segmentation, trend identification) | Validating findings, gathering quantitative + qualitative data |
| **Immersion** | Getting directly involved in the user's environment to share the same experience | Challenging assumptions, building empathy, enhancing team-user collaboration |

## Phase 1.2: Stakeholder Mapping

```markdown
## Stakeholder Map

| Stakeholder | Role | Interest Level | Influence | Needs |
|-------------|------|----------------|-----------|-------|
| End Users | Use product | High | Medium | [Needs] |
| Decision Maker | Approves | Medium | High | [Needs] |
| Technical Team | Builds | High | Medium | [Needs] |
| [Other] | | | | |

### Key Stakeholder Insights
- **Must satisfy**: [Stakeholder] because [reason]
- **Must inform**: [Stakeholder] because [reason]
- **Must consult**: [Stakeholder] because [reason]
```

## Phase 1.3: Competitive Analysis

```markdown
## Competitive Landscape

### Direct Competitors
| Competitor | Strengths | Weaknesses | Our Differentiator |
|------------|-----------|------------|-------------------|
| | | | |

### Indirect Alternatives
| Alternative | Why users choose it | Gap we can fill |
|-------------|---------------------|-----------------|
| | | |

### Competitive Positioning
- **Our unique value**: [What we do differently]
- **Table stakes**: [Must-have features to compete]
- **Differentiators**: [Features that set us apart]
```

## Phase 1.3b: Market Research Frameworks

Use the appropriate framework(s) depending on context. For full market research methodology, see the **market-researcher** skill.

### SWOT Analysis

Identify internal strengths/weaknesses and external opportunities/threats:

| | Helpful | Harmful |
|---|---------|---------|
| **Internal** | Strengths | Weaknesses |
| **External** | Opportunities | Threats |

### Porter's Five Forces

Analyze competitive forces within your market:
1. Bargaining power of suppliers
2. Bargaining power of customers
3. Threat of new entrants
4. Threat of substitute products
5. Intensity of competitive rivalry

### PESTLE Analysis

Analyze macro-environmental factors impacting your product:
- **P**olitical | **E**conomic | **S**ociocultural | **T**echnological | **L**egal | **E**nvironmental
