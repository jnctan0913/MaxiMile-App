# PM Reference: Agile Foundations

> "Agile is not just for software, it's a change in culture." -- Jeff Sutherland

## The 4 Agile Values

The PM operates within an Agile context. Always embody these values:

1. **Individuals and Interactions** over Processes and Tools -- people and collaboration first
2. **Working Software** over Comprehensive Documentation -- deliver functional product iteratively
3. **Customer Collaboration** over Contract Negotiation -- continuous user involvement and feedback
4. **Responding to Change** over Following a Plan -- embrace flexibility and adaptability

## Key Agile Manifesto Principles (PM-Relevant)

- Satisfy the customer through **early and continuous delivery of valuable software**
- Welcome **changing requirements, even late in development**
- Deliver working software frequently, with preference to **shorter timescales**
- **Businesspeople and developers must work together daily**
- Build around **motivated individuals** -- give them trust and support
- **Working software** is the primary measure of progress
- Promote **sustainable development** at a constant pace
- **Simplicity** -- maximize the amount of work NOT done
- Best designs emerge from **self-organizing teams**
- Team regularly **reflects** and adjusts behavior

---

## Scrum Framework Awareness

The PM works closely with Scrum. Understand the framework you hand off into:

### Scrum Roles
- **Product Owner**: Holder of product value -- determines what to build, sets priorities (this is the PM's closest counterpart)
- **Scrum Master**: Servant leader -- protects the Scrum process, removes blockers
- **Development Team**: Self-organizing group -- determines how to deliver in frequent increments

### Scrum Artifacts
- **Product Backlog**: Prioritized list of all features/requirements (PM owns this)
- **Sprint Backlog**: Subset of backlog items selected for the current sprint
- **Burndown Chart**: Visual tracking of remaining work in a sprint

### Scrum Ceremonies (the PM should attend/support)
- **Sprint Planning**: Select backlog items for the sprint, define sprint goal
- **Daily Stand-ups**: Brief sync on progress and blockers
- **Sprint Reviews**: Demo working software to stakeholders, gather feedback
- **Retrospectives**: Team reflects on process and improves

## Agile SDLC & Sprint Structure

The Agile software development life cycle is iterative and incremental:

```
RELEASE PLAN: Sprint 0 (Kick-off) -> Sprint 1 -> Sprint 2 -> ... -> Sprint n -> RELEASE
SPRINT PLAN:  Plan (Day 1) -> Track (Days 2-9) -> Demo (Day 10)
```

- **Sprint 0**: Initial setup, architecture decisions, backlog refinement
- Each sprint follows: **Plan -> Track -> Demo** cycle
- Working software is delivered at the end of every sprint

## PM vs Project Manager (Know the Difference)

| Dimension | Project Manager | Product Manager |
|-----------|----------------|-----------------|
| **Primary Objective** | Deliver scope on time, within budget | Maximize product value and outcomes over lifecycle |
| **Success Metric** | Schedule adherence, cost control | Customer impact, adoption, revenue, retention |
| **Time Horizon** | Finite (project start -> end) | Ongoing (continuous discovery & iteration) |
| **Decision Lens** | Execution optimization (resources, dependencies) | Value optimization (market needs, prioritization) |
| **Ownership** | Manages delivery process | Owns product vision, roadmap, problem selection (what & why) |

---

## B2B vs B2C Product Management Awareness

Understand which context you're operating in, as it shapes your approach:

| Dimension | B2B PM | B2C PM |
|-----------|--------|--------|
| **Customer Structure** | Multi-stakeholder buying group (buyer, user, IT, legal) | Individual end-user or household |
| **Value Proposition** | ROI, efficiency, compliance, integration | Convenience, delight, status, habit formation |
| **Sales Motion** | High-touch, longer cycles, procurement-driven | Self-serve, high-volume acquisition funnels |
| **Roadmapping** | Account-driven, integrations, contractual | Data-driven, experimentation, growth loops |
| **Metrics** | ACV, LTV, retention by account, expansion revenue | DAU/MAU, conversion, ARPU, CAC, retention cohorts |

---

## Team Topology Awareness (Spotify Model)

Understand how the development organization is structured, as it affects how you communicate, prioritize, and hand off work:

| Unit | Description | PM Relevance |
|------|-------------|-------------|
| **Squad** | Small, cross-functional, self-organizing team that delivers a specific functionality end-to-end | Your primary delivery team -- align backlog to squad capacity |
| **Tribe** | Group of squads working on a larger product area/domain; defines overall strategy | Align your roadmap with the tribe's strategic direction |
| **Chapter** | Group sharing a common skill/interest (e.g., front-end, UX research) across squads | Leverage for specialized input and quality standards |
| **Guild** | Community of shared technology, methodology, or field interest across tribes | Source of cross-cutting best practices and innovation |

**Strengths**: Autonomy, collaboration, continuous improvement, cross-functional delivery
**Weaknesses**: Risk of duplicating efforts across squads; lack of clear reporting lines can blur accountability

> When handing off to Scrum Master, clarify which squad/tribe context applies to ensure proper alignment.
