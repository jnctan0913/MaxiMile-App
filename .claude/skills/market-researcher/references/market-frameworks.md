## PESTLE Analysis (Market-Level)

PESTLE examines the macro-environmental factors that affect the market and product opportunity. Every finding must include a citation.

```markdown
## PESTLE Analysis: [Market/Industry]

| Factor | Finding | Impact on Product | Source |
|--------|---------|-------------------|--------|
| **Political** | [Regulations, government policies, trade agreements, political stability, tax policy] | [How it affects us] | [Citation + Link] |
| **Economic** | [GDP trends, inflation, spending patterns, funding climate, interest rates, unemployment] | [How it affects us] | [Citation + Link] |
| **Social** | [Demographics, culture shifts, behavior changes, attitudes, education, health consciousness] | [How it affects us] | [Citation + Link] |
| **Technological** | [Emerging tech, adoption curves, infrastructure changes, R&D activity, automation] | [How it affects us] | [Citation + Link] |
| **Legal** | [Data privacy laws, IP regulations, labor laws, licensing requirements, consumer protection] | [How it affects us] | [Citation + Link] |
| **Environmental** | [Sustainability trends, ESG expectations, climate impact, resource scarcity, green regulations] | [How it affects us] | [Citation + Link] |

### Key Implications
1. **Opportunity**: [Derived from PESTLE findings -- cite the factor(s)]
2. **Threat**: [Derived from PESTLE findings -- cite the factor(s)]
3. **Strategic Consideration**: [How to respond -- what this means for product decisions]
```

### PESTLE Best Practices
- Focus on factors that are **relevant to your specific market** -- do not list generic observations
- Prioritize factors that are **changing** (trends), not static
- For each factor, articulate the **so what** -- how does this specifically affect the product opportunity?
- Date-stamp all data; macro factors change rapidly
- In STANDARD tier, focus on the 2-3 most impactful factors rather than completing all six

## Porter's Five Forces (Industry-Level)

Porter's Five Forces assesses the structural attractiveness of the industry. Every assessment must be backed by evidence.

```markdown
## Porter's Five Forces Analysis: [Industry]

| Force | Intensity | Evidence | Source |
|-------|-----------|----------|--------|
| **Threat of New Entrants** | High/Medium/Low | [Barriers to entry: capital requirements, regulation, brand loyalty, economies of scale, access to distribution, IP/patents] | [Citation + Link] |
| **Bargaining Power of Suppliers** | High/Medium/Low | [Supplier concentration, switching costs, differentiation of inputs, importance of volume to supplier, threat of forward integration] | [Citation + Link] |
| **Bargaining Power of Buyers** | High/Medium/Low | [Buyer concentration, price sensitivity, availability of alternatives, switching costs, buyer information, threat of backward integration] | [Citation + Link] |
| **Threat of Substitutes** | High/Medium/Low | [Alternative solutions, switching costs, price-performance of substitutes, buyer propensity to substitute] | [Citation + Link] |
| **Competitive Rivalry** | High/Medium/Low | [Number of competitors, industry growth rate, product differentiation, exit barriers, fixed costs, strategic stakes] | [Citation + Link] |

### Industry Attractiveness Score
[Overall assessment based on five forces -- is this an attractive market to enter?]

### Force-by-Force Detail

#### 1. Threat of New Entrants
**Assessment**: [High/Medium/Low]
**Key barriers**:
- [Barrier 1]: [Description and evidence] -- [Source]
- [Barrier 2]: [Description and evidence] -- [Source]
**Implication**: [What this means for our entry/positioning]

#### 2. Bargaining Power of Suppliers
**Assessment**: [High/Medium/Low]
**Key factors**:
- [Factor 1]: [Description and evidence] -- [Source]
- [Factor 2]: [Description and evidence] -- [Source]
**Implication**: [What this means for our cost structure and partnerships]

#### 3. Bargaining Power of Buyers
**Assessment**: [High/Medium/Low]
**Key factors**:
- [Factor 1]: [Description and evidence] -- [Source]
- [Factor 2]: [Description and evidence] -- [Source]
**Implication**: [What this means for our pricing power and customer acquisition]

#### 4. Threat of Substitutes
**Assessment**: [High/Medium/Low]
**Key substitutes**:
- [Substitute 1]: [Description, price-performance comparison] -- [Source]
- [Substitute 2]: [Description, price-performance comparison] -- [Source]
**Implication**: [What this means for our value proposition]

#### 5. Competitive Rivalry
**Assessment**: [High/Medium/Low]
**Key dynamics**:
- [Dynamic 1]: [Description and evidence] -- [Source]
- [Dynamic 2]: [Description and evidence] -- [Source]
**Implication**: [What this means for our competitive strategy]
```

### Porter's Five Forces Best Practices
- Rate each force as High, Medium, or Low intensity -- do not leave vague
- Every rating must be justified with specific evidence, not just assertions
- Consider how forces are **changing over time**, not just their current state
- In STANDARD tier, provide the summary table; in FULL tier, include force-by-force detail
- The "Industry Attractiveness Score" should synthesize all five forces into a clear go/no-go signal

## SWOT Analysis (Market-Opportunity Level)

SWOT analyzes the intersection of internal capabilities and external market conditions. External factors (Opportunities, Threats) must be cited.

```markdown
## SWOT Analysis: [Product/Opportunity]

|  | **Helpful** | **Harmful** |
|--|-------------|-------------|
| **Internal** | **Strengths**: [Our advantages, unique capabilities, team expertise, technology, resources] | **Weaknesses**: [Our gaps, resource constraints, missing capabilities, dependencies] |
| **External** | **Opportunities**: [Market gaps, trends in our favor, unmet needs, regulatory tailwinds, emerging segments] -- [Source] | **Threats**: [Competitive moves, regulatory risks, market shifts, technology disruption, economic headwinds] -- [Source] |

### Detailed Breakdown

#### Strengths (Internal, Helpful)
1. **[Strength]**: [Description -- why this is an advantage]
2. **[Strength]**: [Description]
3. **[Strength]**: [Description]

#### Weaknesses (Internal, Harmful)
1. **[Weakness]**: [Description -- why this is a gap and what impact it has]
2. **[Weakness]**: [Description]
3. **[Weakness]**: [Description]

#### Opportunities (External, Helpful)
1. **[Opportunity]**: [Description with market evidence] -- [Source + Link]
2. **[Opportunity]**: [Description with market evidence] -- [Source + Link]
3. **[Opportunity]**: [Description with market evidence] -- [Source + Link]

#### Threats (External, Harmful)
1. **[Threat]**: [Description with market evidence] -- [Source + Link]
2. **[Threat]**: [Description with market evidence] -- [Source + Link]
3. **[Threat]**: [Description with market evidence] -- [Source + Link]
```

### Strategic Implications (TOWS Matrix)

The TOWS matrix pairs SWOT elements to generate strategic options:

```markdown
### Strategic Implications

#### S+O Strategies (Leverage)
Use strengths to capture opportunities:
- Use [strength] to capture [opportunity] -- **Action**: [Specific recommendation]

#### W+O Strategies (Improve)
Address weaknesses to access opportunities:
- Address [weakness] to access [opportunity] -- **Action**: [Specific recommendation]

#### S+T Strategies (Defend)
Use strengths to mitigate threats:
- Use [strength] to mitigate [threat] -- **Action**: [Specific recommendation]

#### W+T Strategies (Avoid/Exit)
Weakness + threat = danger zone:
- [Weakness] + [threat] = [risk description] -- **Action**: [Specific recommendation -- may include pivoting, partnering, or avoiding]
```

### SWOT Best Practices
- **Internal factors** (Strengths, Weaknesses) are about your team/product -- be honest and specific
- **External factors** (Opportunities, Threats) are about the market -- must be cited with sources
- Avoid vague entries like "strong team" or "competitive market" -- be specific about what and why
- Limit to 3-5 items per quadrant; prioritize the most impactful
- The TOWS matrix is where the real strategic value lies -- always complete it
- In STANDARD tier, the summary table and key implications are sufficient
- In FULL tier, include the detailed breakdown and full TOWS matrix
- Revisit SWOT after completing all other research phases -- it should synthesize everything learned
