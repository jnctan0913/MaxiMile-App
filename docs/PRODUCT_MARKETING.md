**Tier**: FULL
**Status**: Draft

## Executive Summary

MaxiMile is Singapore's first context-aware mobile app that recommends the optimal credit card at the point of payment — turning complex miles rules into a single, instant decision. This product marketing strategy targets 200,000–400,000 miles-focused professionals in Singapore through a community-led, trust-first go-to-market approach. Core positioning: **"The right card. Every time."** — emphasizing smarter decisions with minimal effort, not full automation (until bank API integration in v2).

## 1. Product Positioning

### 1.1 Positioning Framework (6 Elements)

#### Target Customer

**Who is the ideal customer for this product?**

- **Primary segment**: Active Miles Optimizers ("Maya") — urban PMETs, 25–45, holding 3–7 miles credit cards, earning SGD 7K–12K/month, digitally literate, travel 2–3x/year. Read MileLion/Suitesmile, participate in Telegram groups, maintain spreadsheets of card rules.
- **Secondary segment**: Passive Miles Holders ("Peter") — professionals, 25–35, holding 2–3 miles cards, using one "safe" card for everything. Know they're leaving miles on the table but find tracking too tedious. Would engage with an automated solution.
- **Demographics**: Singapore residents, PMETs, high digital literacy, mid-to-high income
- **Psychographics**: Value efficiency and optimization. Experience FOMO about missed miles. Want to feel "smart about money." Travel-aspirational — miles represent access to premium travel experiences.

#### Frame of Reference

**What other products or solutions will customers compare against?**

- **Category**: Real-time credit card rewards optimization (emerging category — no direct equivalent in Singapore)
- **Direct alternatives customers use today**:
  - Personal spreadsheets / Notes apps (DIY tracking)
  - MileLion / Suitesmile blog guides (static, informational)
  - Memory / gut feel at checkout (default behavior)
  - Telegram miles groups (crowdsourced, unstructured)
- **Adjacent alternatives**:
  - SingSaver / MoneySmart (card comparison — acquisition, not optimization)
  - Seedly (expense tracking — no card recommendation)
  - Kris+ (earn miles at partner merchants — doesn't recommend which card)
- **Global analogues (US, not available in SG)**:
  - CardPointers (US$45–90/year subscription)
  - MaxRewards (US$60/year; US$3M seed funding)
  - Kudos (free; US$10.2M Series A from QED Investors)

#### Point of Difference

**What makes MaxiMile unique compared to the frame of reference?**

1. **Real-time, state-aware recommendations**: Unlike blogs and comparison sites that provide static information, MaxiMile knows your *current* spending state — remaining caps, cumulative spend this month — and adjusts recommendations accordingly. When your DBS Altitude dining cap is exhausted, MaxiMile automatically switches to your next best card.

2. **Portfolio-personalized at point of payment**: Recommendations are based on *your actual cards*, not generic "best cards" lists. One tap at checkout. Answer in <1 second. No reading, no calculation, no guesswork.

3. **First and only in Singapore**: No product in Singapore currently operates at the intersection of real-time timing + personalized portfolio awareness + spending-state tracking. The model is validated globally (US apps raised US$13M+ collectively) but nobody has built it for Singapore's credit card ecosystem.

#### Reasons to Believe

**Why should target customers believe the stated point of difference?**

| Proof Point | Evidence |
|-------------|----------|
| **US market validation** | CardPointers (Apple App of the Day), MaxRewards (US$3M seed), Kudos (US$10.2M Series A from QED Investors) — collectively proved the model works |
| **Community-validated pain** | HardwareZone forums: users reporting giving up miles chasing due to complexity (7→2 cards). MileLion: ~948K monthly visits from users actively seeking optimization help |
| **Survey data** | Customer validation survey confirms: majority report cap breaches, low confidence in card selection, and high appeal for MCC-based recommendations (≥4/5) |
| **29 cards, real rules** | Database covers 29 Singapore miles cards with verified earn rates, category rules, caps, and exclusions — sourced from bank T&Cs |
| **Transparent recommendations** | Every recommendation shows *why*: earn rate, remaining cap, and fallback option. No black box. |
| **KrisFlyer devaluation urgency** | Nov 2025 KrisFlyer devaluation (+5–20% cost increase) and introduction of dynamic pricing makes every suboptimally-spent dollar more costly than ever |

#### Benefits Statement

**What is MaxiMile's value proposition and key customer benefits?**

- **Primary benefit**: Earn 20–40% more miles per dollar by always using the right card — without the mental overhead of tracking rules across 3–7 cards
- **Secondary benefits**:
  - Never unknowingly exceed a bonus cap again (automated tracking with visual alerts)
  - See your complete miles picture across airline programs and bank points in one place
  - Quantify the value of optimization: "You earned 1,240 more miles than the average Singapore cardholder this month"
  - Stay ahead of rate changes with proactive alerts when banks modify earn rates or caps

#### Brand Association

**What perceptions, emotions, and associations does the brand embody?**

- **Brand personality**: Smart but approachable. Expert but not elitist. Like having a knowledgeable friend who happens to know every card rule — and whispers the answer at checkout.
- **Emotional connection**: Confidence at every tap. The relief of knowing you're not leaving miles on the table. The satisfaction of "winning" the miles game without the spreadsheet.
- **What the brand stands for**: Empowering everyday cardholders to get the most from what they already have — without needing a PhD in credit card T&Cs.
- **What the brand does NOT stand for**: We are not a card comparison or application site. We don't push you to sign up for new cards. We help you *use* the cards you have, optimally.

### 1.2 Positioning Statement

> **For** miles-focused professionals in Singapore who hold multiple credit cards,
> **who** struggle to track complex earn rates, bonus caps, and rule changes across 3–7 cards at the point of payment,
> **MaxiMile is a** context-aware mobile miles optimization app
> **that** instantly recommends the optimal card for every transaction — personalized to your portfolio, aware of your remaining caps, and updated when banks change rates.
> **Unlike** static blogs, comparison sites, and manual spreadsheets,
> **MaxiMile** delivers real-time, state-aware, and transparent recommendations that eliminate guesswork and maximize every swipe.

**MaxiMile occupies the only position that is both real-time AND personalized.** No competitor in Singapore operates in this quadrant.

## 2. Value Proposition

### 2.1 Value Proposition Statement

**"The right card. Every time. Zero guesswork."**

MaxiMile tells you exactly which card to tap at checkout — personalized to your portfolio, aware of your remaining bonus caps, and updated when rates change. Earn more miles. Stress less.

### 2.2 Value Proposition Structure

- **For** urban working professionals in Singapore who use multiple credit cards for airline miles

- **Our product** MaxiMile **is a** context-aware mobile miles optimization app
- **That** eliminates the guesswork at checkout by recommending the optimal card in <1 second — personalized, state-aware, and transparent
- **Unlike** blogs that require you to read and remember, comparison sites that only help you choose cards (not use them), and spreadsheets that nobody maintains past week two
- **Our product** is the only solution in Singapore that combines your actual card portfolio + your real-time spending state + point-of-payment timing into a single, instant recommendation

### 2.3 Value Proposition by Persona

| Persona | Core Message | Proof Point |

## 3. Brand Story & Messaging

### 3.1 Brand Narrative Arc

**1. The World Before (Status Quo / Pain)**

You're standing at the restaurant counter, wallet out, 4 cards staring back at you. Is it the DBS Altitude or the OCBC 90°N that gives 4 mpd for dining? Have you hit the $1,000 cap on DBS this month? You check your mental math... give up... and tap your "safe" card. Another 200 miles left on the table.

You've tried spreadsheets. They lasted two weeks. You've bookmarked MileLion guides. But you can't read a blog at the checkout counter. You've even asked Telegram groups — but generic advice doesn't account for *your* cards, *your* caps, *your* spending this month.

Singapore has one of the highest credit card penetrations in Asia. There are 8.8 million cards in circulation. KrisFlyer just hit 10 million members globally. And yet — every miles-focused cardholder is still playing a manual guessing game at every checkout.

**2. The Turning Point (Why Now)**

Three things changed:
- Contactless payments became dominant. There's literally no time at checkout to think.
- KrisFlyer devalued in November 2025. Every suboptimally-spent dollar now costs more in miles.
- In the US, apps like Kudos raised US$10.2M proving this exact model works — but nobody built it for Singapore.

The gap was staring at the market. We decided to fill it.

**3. The Solution (MaxiMile)**

MaxiMile is the answer to "which card should I use?" — asked 3–7 times a day, answered in under 1 second.

Add your cards once. Open the app at checkout. Tap your spending category. See exactly which card to use, why, and how much cap you have left. Log the transaction in 20 seconds. Your cap tracker updates. Your miles counter grows. Next time you check, it tells you: "You earned 1,240 more miles than the average Singapore cardholder this month."

It's not a blog. It's not a comparison site. It's not a spreadsheet. It's the miles co-pilot that sits in your pocket.

**4. The Transformation (After State)**

Maya no longer freezes at checkout. She taps confidently, knowing MaxiMile has already done the math. When her DBS cap runs out mid-month, she knows instantly — the app switched her recommendation before she even noticed.

Peter didn't change his behavior. He just opens an app instead of guessing. Three months in, he's earned enough extra miles for a business class upgrade to Bangkok. "I should have done this years ago."

**5. The Proof (Evidence)**

- 29 Singapore miles cards with verified rules, caps, and exclusions
- Survey-validated: majority of respondents report cap breaches and low optimization confidence
- US precedent: CardPointers, MaxRewards, and Kudos raised US$13M+ collectively — same model, different market
- KrisFlyer's explosive growth (5M → 10M members in 3 years) proves the miles audience is expanding, not contracting

### 3.2 Emotional Hook

*Everyone hates that moment at the checkout counter — the second of doubt, the mental arithmetic that never quite adds up, the nagging feeling you just lost miles you'll never get back.* MaxiMile turns that moment from anxiety into confidence.

### 3.3 Key Message (The One Thing)

**"MaxiMile is the only app in Singapore that tells you which card to tap — personalized to your cards, aware of your caps, updated in real-time."**

### 3.4 Messaging Honesty Policy

Per the Problem-Solution Analysis, the product requires manual transaction logging in v1. All messaging must:

- **Do**: Say "smarter decisions with minimal logging" / "instant recommendations, quick logging"
- **Don't**: Claim "fully automated" / "zero effort" / "hands-free" — until bank API integration (v2) removes manual input
- **Do**: Acknowledge the logging step as part of the core loop that makes cap tracking accurate
- **Don't**: Hide the logging requirement; surface it as a feature ("10-second quick-log keeps your caps accurate")

---

## 4. Go-to-Market Strategy

### 4.1 Market Entry Strategy

- **Positioning**: First-mover in a category-creation play. Not competing with blogs or comparison sites — complementing them. Position as "the tool that makes their advice actionable."
- **Timing**: Launch Q2 2026 (beta). Public launch Q3 2026. Aligned with mid-year period when card promotions typically refresh.
- **Market approach**: Product-led growth (PLG) with community seeding. Free tier drives adoption; premium conversion monetizes.

### 4.2 Early Adopters

**Target segments most likely to adopt early:**

1. **MileLion Telegram community** (31,300+ members) — already engaged, high intent, organized around the exact problem MaxiMile solves
2. **HardwareZone Credit Cards subforum** — active users who created crowdsourced spreadsheets (direct demand signal for automation)
3. **Seedly personal finance community** (500K+ users) — already track expenses; natural extension to card optimization
4. **r/singaporefi Reddit community** — tech-savvy, optimization-minded, early adopter profile

**Early adopter profile**: Holds 3+ miles cards. Reads at least one miles blog. Has tried (and possibly abandoned) a spreadsheet. Uses contactless payments. Checks KrisFlyer balance at least monthly. Aged 27–40.

**Engagement plan**:
- Seed product with 50–100 beta users from MileLion Telegram (invite-only beta with feedback loop)
- Co-create content with MileLion / Suitesmile: "We tested MaxiMile for a month — here's how many extra miles we earned"
- Community AMA / demo sessions in Telegram groups pre-launch

### 4.3 Pricing Strategy

| Model | Price | What's Included |
|-------|-------|-----------------|
| **Free Tier** | SGD 0 | Card recommendations for up to 3 cards; cap tracking; transaction logging; basic Miles Portfolio |
| **Premium** | SGD 4.99/month (SGD 49.99/year) | Unlimited cards; advanced earning insights; rate change alerts; full Miles Portfolio with transfer nudges; priority rule updates |

**Rationale**: See Section 8 for detailed pricing analysis. Freemium validated by survey (majority prefer freemium; median WTP SGD 3–5/month). US analogues price at US$45–90/year. SGD 49.99/year is competitive for the Singapore market — roughly the value of one missed bonus cap per month.

**Launch promotion**: First 1,000 users get 3 months free Premium (drive adoption, build habit, collect feedback).

### 4.4 Sales & Distribution Plan

MaxiMile is a **B2C self-serve product**. There is no sales team in v1.

- **Distribution**: iOS App Store + Google Play Store
- **Primary channel**: Community-driven (miles Telegram groups, forums, word-of-mouth)
- **Secondary channel**: Content partnerships (MileLion, Suitesmile guest posts / reviews)
- **Tertiary channel**: App Store Optimization (ASO) targeting "miles credit card Singapore," "which card to use," "KrisFlyer miles optimizer"

### 4.5 Marketing Plan

**Pre-Launch (4 weeks before)**:
- Teaser in MileLion Telegram: "We're building an app that answers 'which card should I use?' in under 1 second. Want early access?"
- Landing page with waitlist (email capture) + explainer video (60 sec)
- Seed 50–100 beta testers from waitlist for product feedback

**Launch Week**:
- MileLion co-branded launch article: "MaxiMile Review — Does It Actually Earn You More Miles?"
- Product Hunt launch (SG tech community crossover)
- Reddit AMA on r/singaporefi
- Social posts (Instagram/TikTok): "Watch me tap the right card in 2 seconds" demo video

**Post-Launch (Ongoing)**:
- Monthly "Miles Saved" leaderboard (opt-in, anonymized) — community engagement
- Content SEO: "Which card to use for dining in Singapore 2026" (long-tail, intent-rich)
- Quarterly "State of Miles" report leveraging aggregated (anonymized) MaxiMile data — positions the brand as the authority
- User testimonials / case studies: "How Maya earned 15,000 extra miles in 3 months"

### 4.6 Partnership Strategy

| Partner | Type | Value Exchange |
|---------|------|---------------|
| **MileLion** | Content + Distribution | MileLion gets exclusive early access + review content; MaxiMile gets 31K+ Telegram reach + credibility endorsement |
| **Suitesmile** | Content | Co-branded strategy guides: "Best cards for dining 2026 + how MaxiMile automates the decision" |
| **Seedly** | Community | Cross-promotion to 500K+ personal finance users; potential app integration |
| **SingSaver / MoneySmart** | Complementary referral (v1.5+) | They drive card *acquisition*; MaxiMile drives card *optimization*. Referral link: "Already have these cards? Optimize them with MaxiMile." |
| **KrisFlyer / Singapore Airlines** | Ecosystem (v2) | Potential Kris+ integration; co-marketing to KrisFlyer members |

### 4.7 Customer Success & Onboarding

**Onboarding flow** (target: <3 minutes):
1. Sign up (email + password)
2. Add your cards (tap from pre-populated list of 29 SG miles cards; rules auto-load)
3. Set initial miles balances per program (optional)
4. See your first recommendation immediately

**Retention tactics**:
- Cap approach alerts (push notification at 80% and 95%)
- Rate change alerts when bank rules change
- Monthly "Earning Report" push: "You earned X miles this month. See your insights."
- "Projected savings" at onboarding: "Based on your 3 cards, you could earn X more miles per month" (addresses Passive Peter cold-start gap)

## 5. GTM Strategy Canvas

### Business Overview

| Section | Details |
|---------|---------|
| **Market Need** | Singapore's 200–400K miles-focused cardholders cannot track complex, constantly-changing card rules (earn rates, monthly caps, MCC exclusions) across 3–7 cards in real-time at the point of payment. This results in thousands of lost miles annually and chronic decision fatigue. |
| **Customer Segments** | (1) Active Optimizers (~100–200K): hold 3–7 cards, read blogs, track manually. (2) Passive Holders (~100–200K): hold 2–3 cards, know they're suboptimal, won't invest effort. (3) Future: Banks seeking card engagement data (B2B, v2). |
| **Value Propositions** | Turn complex multi-card rules into a single, instant, personalized recommendation at the point of payment. Automated cap tracking prevents the #1 cause of miles loss. Miles Portfolio gives complete visibility across programs. |
| **Competitive Landscape** | No direct competitor in Singapore. Comparison sites (SingSaver, MoneySmart) help choose cards, not use them. Blogs (MileLion) inform but are static. US apps (Kudos, CardPointers) proved the model but don't support SG cards. |
| **Customer Relationships** | Self-serve app with community engagement. Free tier builds trust; premium subscription monetizes power users. Community forums for feedback and rule verification. |
| **Customer Pains** | (1) Cap breaches losing thousands of miles. (2) 10–30 sec decision fatigue at checkout. (3) Spreadsheet tracking that nobody maintains. (4) No visibility into total miles picture. (5) Rate changes requiring constant re-learning. |
| **Customer Gains** | (1) Confidence at every tap. (2) 20–40% more miles per dollar. (3) Time saved (~30 min/week of spreadsheet work eliminated). (4) Tangible proof of value ("miles saved" metric). (5) One place for all miles across programs. |
| **Pricing** | Freemium: Free (3 cards) / Premium SGD 4.99/month or SGD 49.99/year (unlimited). Launch promo: 3 months free for first 1,000 users. |
| **Channels** | Miles Telegram communities (31K+ MileLion); App Store / Play Store; Content SEO; Miles blog partnerships; Reddit / HardwareZone forums. |

### Go-to-Market Strategy

| Section | Details |
|---------|---------|
| **GTM Overview** | Community-led PLG launch. Validate product-market fit with 1,000 beta users from miles Telegram groups before scaling. Key learning: Will users sustain manual logging? What's the 30-day retention rate? Focus on AARRR Activation (recommendation used) and Retention (weekly return). |
| **Goals** | (1) 5,000 MAU within 6 months. (2) 10,000 MARU (recommendations used) within 6 months. (3) 60%+ monthly retention. (4) 10–15% free-to-premium conversion. |
| **KPIs** | MAU, MARU (Monthly Active Recommendations Used), transaction log rate (target: 70%+), retention (30/60/90-day), NPS (target: 50+), premium conversion rate. |
| **Primary Digital Channels** | (1) MileLion Telegram (31K+, highest-intent). (2) App Store / Play Store (ASO-optimized). (3) r/singaporefi + HardwareZone (early adopter forums). (4) Instagram / TikTok (demo videos for broader reach). |
| **Key Messages** | *Awareness*: "Singapore's first app that tells you which card to tap." *Consideration*: "29 cards. Real-time caps. One recommendation." *Conversion*: "Free to start. Add your cards in 3 minutes." *Retention*: "You earned 1,240 more miles than the average Singaporean this month." |
| **Creative Direction** | Confident, smart, approachable. Use the checkout moment as the emotional anchor. Show the "before" (anxiety, guessing) vs. "after" (confidence, clarity). Avoid fintech jargon. Speak like a knowledgeable friend, not a bank. |
| **Martech** | Analytics: in-app MARU tracking + cohort analysis. Email: onboarding drip + monthly earning report. Push: cap alerts + rate change alerts. Attribution: UTM-tagged community links + referral codes. Gap: No paid acquisition in v1 (PLG only). |

---

## 7. AIDA Messaging Framework

| Stage | Customer Mindset | Our Message | Channel/Tactic | Content |
|-------|-----------------|-------------|----------------|---------|
| **Attention** | "What is it?" | "Singapore's first app that tells you which card to tap for maximum miles." | MileLion Telegram teasers; Product Hunt launch; Instagram/TikTok demo reels; HardwareZone forum post | 60-sec demo video; "Watch me pick the right card in 2 seconds" reel; infographic: "How many miles are you losing?" |
| **Interest** | "I like it." | "29 Singapore miles cards. Real-time bonus caps. One personalized recommendation. Free to start." | MileLion review article; SEO blog posts ("best card for dining Singapore 2026"); Reddit AMA; Seedly community post | Detailed feature walkthrough; "How MaxiMile works" blog post; comparison table (MaxiMile vs. spreadsheet vs. blog); community Q&A |

---

## 8. Pricing Strategy

### 8.1 Pricing Models Evaluated

| Model | Description | Fit for MaxiMile | Rationale |
|-------|-------------|------------------|-----------|
| **Cost-Based** | Price based on infrastructure cost + margin | No | Our costs are low (Supabase usage-based, small team). Cost-based would underprice the value. |
| **Value-Based** | Price based on perceived value to customer | Partial | Users save SGD 200–500+/year in miles. Premium at SGD 49.99/year is <25% of value delivered — strong ROI story. |
| **Competitive** | Price based on competitor pricing | Partial | US analogues: CardPointers US$45–90/year, MaxRewards US$60/year. SGD 49.99/year is competitive when adjusted for SG purchasing power. No direct SG competitor to benchmark against. |
| **Dynamic** | Prices adjust based on demand | No | Not appropriate for subscription SaaS in personal finance. Would erode trust. |
| **Freemium / Tiered** | Free basic version + paid premium | **Yes (Primary)** | Survey validated: majority prefer freemium. Free tier drives adoption and trust-building (critical for first-mover in new category). Premium converts power users who see proven value. |

### 8.2 Recommended Pricing Strategy

**Model**: Freemium with annual discount

| Tier | Price | Features | Target Segment |
|------|-------|----------|----------------|
| **Free** | SGD 0 | Up to 3 cards; category recommendations; basic cap tracking; transaction logging; basic Miles Portfolio (1 program) | Passive Peter; trial users; students |
| **Premium Monthly** | SGD 4.99/month | Unlimited cards; advanced earning insights; rate change alerts; full Miles Portfolio with all programs + transfer nudges; priority rule updates; export data | Active Maya; power users |
| **Premium Annual** | SGD 49.99/year (save 17%) | All Premium features; billed annually | Committed optimizers; best value |

**Why this pricing**:
- **Free tier must be generous enough** to demonstrate value and build trust. 3 cards covers most Passive Peters and gives Active Mayas a taste.
- **Premium at SGD 4.99/month** is below the SGD 200–500+ annual value the product delivers — clear ROI.
- **Annual plan** at SGD 49.99 is a psychological anchor: "less than one cap breach per year."
- **No affiliate revenue in v1**: Trust-first positioning. Recommendations are purely user-optimized, never influenced by bank commissions. This is a key differentiator and should be messaged explicitly.

**Revenue projections (Year 1)**:
- 5,000 MAU × 12% premium conversion = 600 premium users
- 600 × SGD 49.99/year = **SGD ~30,000 ARR**
- Conservative; scales meaningfully at 20K+ MAU (Year 2 target)

### 8.3 Launch Pricing Promotion

- First 1,000 users: **3 months free Premium** (no credit card required)
- Referral program: **1 month free Premium** for every referred user who activates
- MileLion partnership: Exclusive promo code for **20% off annual plan** via MileLion content

## 9. Sales Enablement Package

### 9.1 Messaging & Positioning Guide

**Elevator pitch (30 seconds)**:

> "MaxiMile is Singapore's first app that tells you exactly which credit card to tap for maximum miles — personalized to your cards, aware of your remaining bonus caps, and updated when rates change. Just open the app, tap your spending category, and get the answer in under a second. Free to start."

**Short description (1 paragraph)**:

> MaxiMile is a context-aware mobile app that helps Singapore professionals maximize airline miles from credit card spending. By automatically recommending the optimal card at the point of payment based on earn rates, remaining bonus caps, and real-time spending state, it eliminates the guesswork that costs miles-focused cardholders thousands of miles annually. With 29 Singapore miles cards in its database, automated cap tracking, a comprehensive Miles Portfolio, and rate change alerts, MaxiMile turns the complex "which card should I use?" question into a simple, instant answer.

**Key messages by persona**:

| Persona | Pain Point | Key Message | Proof Point |
|---------|-----------|-------------|-------------|
| **Maya** (Active Optimizer) | Spreadsheet fatigue; cap breaches; anxiety at checkout | "Stop tracking spreadsheets. Start tapping confidently. MaxiMile knows your caps so you don't have to." | Automated cap alerts at 80%/95%. Recommendation switches automatically when cap exhausted. Earn rate + remaining cap shown with every recommendation. |
| **Peter** (Passive Holder) | FOMO about missed miles; finds tracking too tedious | "More miles without the effort. Add your cards, open at checkout, done." | Monthly insights: "You earned X more miles than the SG average." No spreadsheet needed. <20 sec per transaction log. |
| **Miles Blogger / Influencer** | Need tools to recommend to audience; content opportunities | "Give your readers the tool that makes your advice actionable at checkout." | Co-branded content opportunity. Affiliate/referral partnership. Community credibility. |

### 9.2 Objection Handling Guide

| Common Objection | Category | Response | Supporting Evidence |
|-----------------|----------|----------|-------------------|
| "I already use MileLion / Suitesmile guides" | Competition | "MileLion is great for strategy — MaxiMile is great for execution. We make their advice actionable at the moment you need it. Think of us as the tool that turns their guides into real-time, personalized answers." | MileLion is static content; MaxiMile is dynamic and state-aware. Complementary, not competing. |
| "I don't want to manually log every transaction" | Feature gap | "We hear you — and we've made logging as fast as possible (~20 sec, pre-filled fields). Your logging keeps cap tracking accurate, which is what makes our recommendations trustworthy. In v2, we're working on bank API integration to automate this entirely." | Pre-filled category and card. Custom keypad. Immediate cap update feedback. Bank API on roadmap (SGFinDex). |
| "Why would I pay when SingSaver is free?" | Price/Value | "SingSaver helps you choose *which cards to get*. MaxiMile helps you *use the cards you already have* optimally. Different products, different value. And MaxiMile is free to start — 3 cards, full recommendations, no credit card required." | SingSaver monetizes via bank affiliate commissions (card applications). MaxiMile monetizes via user subscription (card optimization). No conflict. |
| "What if the card rules are wrong?" | Trust | "Every rule in our database is verified against bank T&Cs. We show you *why* each card is recommended (earn rate, cap remaining). If anything looks off, you can flag it and we'll verify within 48 hours. Transparency is our #1 design principle." | 29 cards verified against bank T&Cs. Transparent recommendation logic. Rate change alerts when rules update. Community flagging planned. |
| "Singapore market is too small for this" | Viability | "Singapore's 200–400K active miles cardholders spend billions annually on credit cards. The same model raised US$13M+ in the US. And Singapore is the beachhead — the playbook scales to Malaysia, Hong Kong, and broader APAC." | TAM: 400K. US validation. SG cards & payments market: USD 50.37B by 2033. Regional expansion in roadmap. |
| "Banks will just build this themselves" | Threat | "Banks can only optimize across their own cards. DBS will never recommend you use OCBC. MaxiMile is the only cross-bank optimizer — and that's the whole point. We're complementary to banks, not competitive." | No single bank can provide cross-portfolio optimization. This is a structural advantage. |

### 9.3 Content Creation Plan

| Content Type | Purpose | AIDA Stage | Target Persona | Priority | Timeline |
|-------------|---------|------------|----------------|----------|----------|

## 10. B2B vs B2C Analysis

### Market Type Assessment

**MaxiMile is a B2C product** in v1, with B2B potential in v2+.

| Phase | Model | Description |
|-------|-------|-------------|
| **v1 (Launch)** | **B2C** | Direct-to-consumer mobile app. Self-serve onboarding. Freemium monetization. |
| **v1.5+** | **B2C + B2B affiliate** | Referral links to card applications (SingSaver/MoneySmart partnership). Affiliate revenue supplements subscription. |
| **v2** | **B2C + B2B data** | Bank partnerships: anonymized spending pattern data helps banks understand cross-card behavior and optimize their reward structures. |

### B2C Channel Strategy

| Channel | Relevance | Our Priority | Rationale |
|---------|-----------|-------------|-----------|
| **Telegram communities** | Very High | **P0** | MileLion (31K+), Suitesmile, HWZ — highest-intent audience, zero CAC |
| **Content marketing / SEO** | High | **P0** | Long-tail miles queries ("best card for dining Singapore 2026") drive organic acquisition |
| **App Store Optimization** | High | **P0** | Critical for discoverability. Keywords: "miles optimizer," "credit card Singapore," "KrisFlyer" |
| **Instagram / TikTok** | Medium | **P1** | Demo reels for broader awareness. "Watch me pick the right card in 2 seconds" format. |
| **Reddit (r/singaporefi)** | Medium | **P1** | Tech-savvy early adopters. AMA format for launch. |
| **Email marketing** | Medium | **P1** | Waitlist nurture pre-launch; monthly earning report post-launch |
| **Influencer marketing** | Medium | **P1** | MileLion, Suitesmile are the key "influencers" — but they're domain experts, not lifestyle influencers. Approach as partners, not paid promoters. |
| **Paid advertising** | Low | **P2** | Defer to Growth stage. CAC in SG fintech is high (40–60% rise in 2024). PLG first. |
| **LinkedIn** | Low | **P3** | Only relevant for B2B positioning (v2 bank partnerships) |
