## Survey Design Notes

### Objectives

This survey validates critical assumptions before committing to MVP development:

| # | Assumption to Validate | Survey Section | Key Question(s) |
|---|------------------------|----------------|------------------|
| 1 | Users actively optimize card usage for miles | Screening | Screening Q |
| 2 | Target users hold multiple miles cards | Demographics | Q2, Q3 |
| 3 | Users rely on manual/informal methods to decide which card to use | Current Behaviour | Q4, Q5 |
| 4 | Bonus cap tracking is a top pain point | Pain & Frustration | Q7, Q8, Q9 |
| 5 | Users would value MCC-based card recommendations and cap tracking | Reaction to Solution | Q11, Q12, Q13 |
| 6 | Users are willing to check an app at point of payment | Reaction to Solution | Q14 |
| 7 | A meaningful segment will pay for premium features | Willingness to Pay | Q15, Q16, Q17, Q18 |

### Screening & Segmentation Logic

- **Screen-out**: Respondents who do not use credit cards for miles (Screening Q = "No") → end survey with thank-you
- **Persona tagging**: Screening Q response tags each respondent as **Active Optimizer** or **Casual / Newcomer** for segmented analysis throughout

## Survey Introduction

> **Hey there, fellow miles chaser!**

## Analysis Framework

### Key Metrics to Extract

| Metric | Source Questions | Success Threshold | Validates |
|--------|-----------------|-------------------|-----------|
| **Active vs. Casual split** | Screening Q | Understand ratio of active optimizers vs. casual earners; both are viable segments | Persona segmentation |
| **Multi-card prevalence** | Q2 | 60%+ hold 3+ cards | Core assumption |
| **Card portfolio composition** | Q3 | Identify most popular miles cards in Singapore market | Product coverage priority |
| **Manual/informal decision-making** | Q4 | 50%+ use memory, spreadsheets, or single-card default | Problem existence |
| **Optimization confidence** | Q5 | Mean score below 3.5 suggests gap between effort and outcome | Pain point severity |
| **Information sources** | Q6 | Identify top channels for go-to-market strategy | Distribution strategy |
| **Cap tracking behaviour** | Q7 | 50%+ do not track carefully (rough/forget/don't track/unaware) | Pain point severity |
| **Cap breach frequency** | Q8 | 40%+ exceeded cap at least once or are unsure | Pain point validation |
| **Top pain points** | Q9 | MCC uncertainty or cap tracking in top 3 for 50%+ | Feature prioritization |
| **Optimization gap** | Q10 | Majority estimate <85% optimal | Room for improvement |
| **MCC recommendation appeal** | Q11 | Mean score 3.5+ out of 5 | Core feature validation |
| **Cap tracking feature appeal** | Q12 | Mean score 3.5+ out of 5 | Core feature validation |
| **Weekly feature usage** | Q13 | Top features selected by 50%+ | Feature prioritization |
| **Time tolerance at payment** | Q14 | 60%+ willing to spend 5+ seconds | UX design constraint |
| **Current payment for tools** | Q15 | Baseline for willingness-to-pay context | Monetization benchmark |
| **Value drivers for payment** | Q16 | Identify top 2-3 value propositions that drive WTP | Pricing messaging |
| **Pricing model preference** | Q17 | Freemium or subscription preferred by majority | Monetization strategy |
| **Price point** | Q18 | Median/mode price bracket | Pricing strategy |

### Segmentation Plan

Analyze responses segmented by:

1. **Miles engagement level (Screening Q)**: Active Optimizer vs. Casual / Newcomer — primary segmentation axis; expect different pain intensities, feature priorities, and WTP between these groups
2. **Card portfolio size (Q2)**: 1–2 cards vs. 3+ cards (correlates with pain intensity)
3. **Current decision method (Q4)**: Active trackers (memorise/spreadsheet) vs. passive (one card/random) (correlates with engagement)
4. **Age range (Q1)**: Younger (21-29) vs. older segments (correlates with tech comfort and card count)

### Red Flags to Watch For

| Red Flag | Threshold | Implication |
|----------|-----------|-------------|
| Low feature appeal | Mean score below 3.0 on Q11 or Q12 | Core value proposition not resonating |
| Time intolerance | 40%+ select "Won't use if it takes time" on Q14 | Must achieve sub-5-second UX or pivot approach |
| No willingness to pay | 60%+ select "Nothing - I wouldn't pay" on Q16 | Subscription model unviable; must pursue ad/affiliate monetization |
| Price resistance | 50%+ select "$0 (must be free)" on Q18 | Free tier must be substantial; monetize through other means |
| Small card portfolios | 60%+ hold only 1–2 cards on Q2 | Addressable market smaller than assumed; product less differentiated |
| Low cap breach awareness | 50%+ select "No" or "Not sure" on Q8 | Pain point may be latent — needs education-first approach |

### Statistical Significance

With 200–300 responses and a target population of ~200,000 active miles optimizers:
- Margin of error: ~5.7–6.9% at 95% confidence
- Sufficient for directional validation (not statistically representative of all Singapore cardholders)
- Segmented analysis (e.g., by card count) requires minimum 30 respondents per segment
